### How to set up an environment to run the notebooks on your machine

* Clone or download the repo. You can do so by clicking the green button [here](https://github.com/emufti/bigdata23).
* Install `virtualenv` (if you don't already have it). You can use your disribution's package manager or just install it through pip. Either way, you can easily find instructions through your favourite search engine.
* Create a virtual environment called `venv` in this directory with the command `virtualenv venv`.
* Activate the virtual environment. If you are using linux, you can do so with `source venv/bin/activate`. Otherwise, consult your favourite search engine.
* Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Run Jupyter notebook with `jupyter notebook`.
* Open the notebook you want using Jupyter's browser-based interface.
